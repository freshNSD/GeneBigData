# GeneBigData

__*Note: this repository is setup for the final beta test of the course. I plan to make it private prior to official course release date*__

This is a collection of assignment source file for the Coursera class __Big Data, Genes, and Medicine__.

These files were placed here during the 2nd week of beta testing (week of September 5, 2016) due to some testers complaining about corrupted files. I assume that the testers starting the first week had this problem (I started in week 2).

## R lanaguage 

I've taken a few classes on R on Coursera and have some suggestions for those wishing to learn more. If you wish to install R locally, then you can download the install bits from https://www.r-project.org/ and I would suggest installing a GUI tool such as RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/ (both are free).

The Data Science Specialization from Coursera (offered by Johns Hopkins) is basically a 9 class long R tutorial while teaching frequentist statistics. The instructors have also put free (or cheep) reference books on LeanPub https://leanpub.com/ where you can find the following:

* R Programming for Data Science
* Exploratory Data Analysis with R
* Regression Models for Data Science in R
* The Art of Data Science
* Report Writing for Data Science in R
* Developing Data Products in R
* Statistical Inference for Data Science

and more...

There is also a site where you can download R tutorials that will run within your local R environment. Take a look at Swirl http://swirlstats.com/

The Statistics with R from Duke University is a new Coursera offering and includes both Bayesian and frequentist statistics instruction. But the coverage of R is not as gentile as that given by John Hopkins (for instance, the first R assignment throws you directly into Knitr without so much as brief overview of how Knitr works). I'm taking it now mostly for the coverage of the Bayesian approach.

DataCamp https://www.datacamp.com/ has some R offerings 

PluralSight https://www.pluralsight.com/ has some R classes (and offers a 10 day free trial as well)
